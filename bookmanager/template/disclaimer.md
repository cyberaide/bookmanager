# Disclaimer

This book has been generated with [Cyberaide
Bookmanager](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cyberaide-bookmanager). 

Bookmanager is a tool to create a publication from a number of sources on the
internet. It is especially useful to create customized books, lecture notes, or
handouts. Content is best integrated in markdown format as it is very fast to
produce the output. 

Bookmanager has been developed based on our experience over the last 3 years
with a more sophisticated approach. Bookmanager takes the lessons from this
approach and distributes a tool that can easily be used by others.
