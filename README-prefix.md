# Bookmanager

Bookmanager is a tool to create a publication from a number of sources on the
internet. It is especially useful to create customized books, lecture notes, or
handouts. Content is best integrated in markdown format as it is very fast to
produce the output. At present we only produce epubs, but it will be easy to
also create pdf, html, work, odt and others. As we use pandoc we can support the
formats supported by it.

Planed enhancements:

* customized title page
* integration of Refernces
* proper indentation management based on the indentation in teh yaml file
* automated image management
* font management for epubs
